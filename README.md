📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Plan
This repository documents my structured plan for learning and implementing data structures and Algorithms in C++. It includes my timeline, progress, and key resources.

✅ Topics Completed So Far
Basics of C++
Syntax, Input/Output, control structures, functions
C++ STL (Standard Template Library)
Vectors, pairs, maps, sets, priority queues, iterators
Arrays
Declaration, initialization, traversal, problem-solving
Sorting Algorithms
Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search, Binary Search, Two Pointer Technique
Time and Space Complexity
Big-O, Ω, Θ notation, trade-offs
📅 Updated Plan of Action
Below is the revised plan based on current progress and remaining time:

Deadline	Topics
Till 29th June	Recursion, Classes & OOPs, Strings
Till 6th July	Stack, Queue, Linked List
Till 13th July	Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), Heaps
Till 20th July	Graphs, Dynamic Programming
